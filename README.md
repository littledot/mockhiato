Mockhiato is a mock generation CLI tool for the Go programming language. It is designed to be fast and configurable.


- üåÄ Generates mocks for entire projects with a single command.
- üîé Generates mocks for 3rd party interfaces used by your packages. (eg: If your code uses `os.FileInfo`, Mockhiato will generate mocks for it even though it is not part of your package.)  
- ‚ö° Uses `go/loader` to speed up AST parsing.  
- üõ†Ô∏è Highly configurable to suit your organization's coding standards. (eg: mock name format, directory name, etc.)  
- üë∂ Provides easy-to-use and well-documented command line interface.  
- üçª Supports `stretchr/testify`.

## Installation

Install with `go get`.

```
go get -u github.com/littledot/mockhiato
```

## Usage

Mockhiato's main feature is to manage mocks for your Go project.

```
mockhiato generate
```

`generate` creates mocks for the project located at the current working directory by default. Many options are available for customization. Mockhiato currently supports `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock`. Open an issue if you would like another mocking framework to be supported.

```
mockhiato clean
```

`clean` deletes generated mocks.

```
mockhiato generate -h
```

Mockhiato is highly configurable. Append `-h` to commands for more details regarding various options and usages.
