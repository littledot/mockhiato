## Installation

Install with `go get`.

```
go get -u github.com/littledot/mockhiato
```

## Usage

Mockhiato's main feature is to manage mocks for your Go project.

```
mockhiato generate
```

`generate` creates mocks for the project located at the current working directory. Mockhiato currently supports `github.com/stretchr/testify/mock`. Open an issue if you would like another mocking framework to be supported.

```
mockhiato clean
```

`clean` deletes generated mocks.

```
mockhiato generate -h
```

Append `-h` to commands for more details on other usages.
